When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working from multiple devices or when collaborating. Storing files remotely means that everyone 
has access to the entire repository and commit history at all times.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

Particularly when collaborating with others, you might be working on a section that another has modified.
In this case it'd be troublesome to have to deal with conflicts each time another user pushes to GitHub.
Better to work on your own task first, then push/pull when ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are copies of repositories held on the GitHub servers. Clones are copies of repositories created 
locally. Branches are series of commits contained in a single repository. We use forks to make our own 
copy of repository in a case where we are not directly collaborating. Clones are used to make an exact 
copy for offline, local use. Branches are used in collabration or experimentation with the idea to 
merge work at some point in the future.
